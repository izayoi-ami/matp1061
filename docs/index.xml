      <description>Sage (version 7.6) is currently a variant of Python 2. In future version 8, Sage will switch to Python 3.
Sage Environment In this course, we will mainly focus on the usage of Sage Cloud Environment.
Various platforms are available for Sage:
 Local Installation (Using Jupyter notebook or IPython REPL) https://www.sagemath.org Sage Math Cell https://sagecell.sagemath.org Cocalc (Sage Math Cloud) https://cocalc.com  Sage Cell Environment A web environment for short code evaluation, which you may have already used in the selection test.</description>

      <description>Cocalc Former named Sage Math Cloud, one can store all projects and perform computations on the cloud.
Project creation  Project Creation    Create a project with name &amp;ldquo;Self computation&amp;rdquo;. This project is running on a free server, and hence may stop occasionally.  Sage worksheet Let&amp;rsquo;s do some arithmetic in Sage.
 New file    Create a file name &amp;ldquo;1 - arithmetic&amp;rdquo; and select the type &amp;ldquo;Sage Worksheet&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Try to type the following code in the edtior.
Integer addition 2+5  Addition of fractions $\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6}$
1/3 + 1/6  You will see the answer 1/2 is shown as inline form.
Math formatting Use the function show to enclose the expression for mathematical (LaTeX) display.
show(1/3+1/6)  Symbolic addition In Sage, we can handle symbolic computation $x+y+x+x+y$.
var(&amp;quot;x y&amp;quot;) # This line explicitly declares that x and y as symbolic variables.</description>

      <description>Variables Sometimes, it is necessary to hold result of computation and to reuse it in future.
For example, to compute \[(1+2+3+\cdots+10)+(1+2+3+\cdots+10)^2+(1+2+3+\cdots+10)^3\]
 Store the result of $(1+2+3+\cdots+10)$ to a variable N. Compute the result of $$N+N^2+N^3$$.  N = 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 N + N^2 + N^3  We use the operator = for storing (assignment),
i.e. to store the result of right-hand-side to the variable on the left.
When an assignment is used, the result is suppressed.</description>

      <description>A function/mapping takes objects and returns objects. It is usually written in the form $$ F: A \to B $$ Here, $F$ is the name of the function, $A$ is the possible input and $B$ is the possible output.
The mapping when stated explicitly is denoted $x \mapsto y$.
Example The real $\sqrt{x}$ is a function that takes a number and returns a non-negative number whose square is the input.</description>

      <description>Fibonacci sequence The Fibonacci sequence is: \[1,1,2,3,5,8,13,\cdots\]
The $n^{th}$ term is usually denoted $F_n$.
We use L = [1,1,2,3,5,8,13] to specify a list (zero-indexed sequence) and stores it to L.
One can access the $1^{st}$ term with L[1].
L = [1,1,2,3,5,8,13]  Zero-th index property In programming, list/sequence are usually indexed from zero.
It is common to extend the sequence by the zero-th term, i.e. when $n=0$.
Recall that $$F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n $$, by setting $n=0$, we have $F_n = 0$.</description>

      <title>Divisibility</title>
      <link>https://matp1061.netlify.com/modular_arithmetic/divisibility/</link>

      <description>Divisibility for 7, 11 and 13 We have the alternating 3-digit sum for 7, 11 and 13:
To find $210600900 \bmod{} 7$, we can proceed by: $(900-600+210) \bmod{} 7$.
The idea behind is
$$210600900 =210\times1000^{2}+600\times1000+900$$ $$1 =1$$ $$1000 =\left(1001\right)-1$$ $$1000^{2} =1001M+1$$ where $M$ is some integer, hence $1000^2$ is the sum of $1$ and a multiple of $1001$.
Since $7 \times 11 \times 13 = 1001 = 1000 + 1 = 10^3 + 1$, any multiple of $1001$ is automatically that of $7$, $11$ and $13$.</description>

      <title>Euclidean algorithm</title>

      <description>Property Greatest common divisor (gcd) and lowest common factor (lcm) of numbers $a$ and $b$ are related by
$$a\times b= \mathrm{gcd}(a,b) \times \mathrm{\ell cm}(a,b)$$
The gcd function (which takes two inputs) has the following properties:
$$\mathrm{gcd}(a,b) = \mathrm{gcd}(b,a)$$ $$\mathrm{gcd}(a,b) = \mathrm{gcd}(a,b-a)$$ $$\mathrm{gcd}(a,0) = a $$
By repeated application of the second rule, we have
$$\mathrm{gcd}(a,b) = \mathrm{gcd}(a,b \bmod a)$$
Example
$$\mathrm{gcd}(300,144) = \mathrm{gcd}(144,300 - 2\times 144) = \mathrm{gcd}(144,12) = \mathrm{gcd}(12, 144 - 12\times12) = 12 $$</description>
