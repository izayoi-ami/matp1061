Sage (version 7.6) is currently a variant of Python 2. In future version 8, Sage will switch to Python 3.

## Sage Environment

In this course, we will mainly focus on the usage of Sage Cloud Environment.

Various platforms are available for Sage:

- Local Installation (Using Jupyter notebook or IPython REPL) https://www.sagemath.org
- Sage Math Cell https://sagecell.sagemath.org
- Cocalc (Sage Math Cloud) https://cocalc.com


### Sage Cell Environment

A web environment for short code evaluation, which you may have already used in the selection test.

For example, to compute $$\pi$$ up to 1000 digits.
